* I am a third year Ph.D. student at [Penn State University](www.ime.psu.edu), advised by [Dr. Eunhye Song](https://sites.google.com/view/eunhyesongphd/home). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Fudan University and master's degree in Statistics at Columbia University.

* My research interests lie across many topics: uncertainty quantification; simulation optimization and stochastic optimization; non-parametric methods and highdimensional statistics.
